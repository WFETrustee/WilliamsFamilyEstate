    <h1>Public Notice of Equitable Standing; Clarification of Prior Language</h1>

    <p>Venue: Williams Family Estate Public Notice Ledger — Identifier: GEN-0002</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This notice is issued by the Trustee of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span> to
        reaffirm exclusive operation in equity and to clarify that certain phrases which may have
        appeared in prior filings—if construed as invoking statutory jurisdiction—were inadvertent,
        are not adopted, and shall not be taken as consent, submission, or joinder to any foreign
        jurisdiction. Equity looks to the intent rather than the form; the Estate’s intent has been,
        and remains, to stand in honor in equity only.
      </p>

      <h2>Standing and Intent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trustee Capacity:</strong> All acts are performed by the living man,
          Gregory-Alan: Williams, in the private office of Trustee for the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span>.
          No act is performed as surety or accommodation party for any legal person/DEBTOR.</li>
        <li><strong>No Joinder:</strong> Nothing herein or in prior filings shall be construed as
          consent, appearance, or submission to statutory jurisdiction. Any language susceptible
          of such interpretation is expressly disclaimed and corrected by this notice.</li>
        <li><strong>Reservation of Rights:</strong> All rights are reserved—without prejudice,
          without recourse—under God and in equity.</li>
        <!--<li><strong>Agency Disclosure:</strong> The Trustee acts at all times as Agent for the Principal — the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span>. No presumption of personal liability, suretyship, or assumption of public office shall attach to the living man acting in trust capacity. Where a presentment names the LEGAL PERSON or creates the appearance of contract, it is rebutted and returned in honor by the Trustee in agency, without assumption of liability.</li>

      <h2>Clarifications Concerning Prior Language</h2>
      <p>The following examples illustrate phrasing that may have appeared in prior documents and are hereby clarified. These examples are not exhaustive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“/s/” or “signature” blocks:</strong> Any autograph by the Trustee is an act in equity,
          in the office of Trustee, and is not a statutory “signature” creating joinder, suretyship,
          or appearance. Standard closing henceforth:
          <em>“All Rights Reserved — Without Prejudice.”</em></li>

        <li><strong>“Penalty of perjury” clauses:</strong> Such phrases are statutory. Where they appeared,
          they were inadvertent and are not adopted. The Trustee attests in equity:
          <em>“I affirm in equity, in good conscience before God, that the foregoing is true, correct, and complete.”</em></li>

        <li><strong>UCC citations (e.g., §1-308) as reservations:</strong> Where referenced, they were
          not invocations of statutory authority over the Estate but were cited, if at all, as public
          record acknowledgments. Reservation in equity controls and is sufficient without statutory citation.</li>

        <li><strong>“Submit,” “application,” or similar statutory-sounding verbs:</strong> The Estate does not
          “submit” to an authority; it <em>presents notice</em>, <em>tenders</em> performance, or <em>publishes</em> a record.</li>

        <li><strong>“Under the laws of the United States” or similar constructions:</strong> Where such language
          appeared, it is not consent or joinder but inadvertent phrasing. The Estate stands in equity;
          statutory references (USC, CFR, UCC, etc.) are treated as <em>public record acknowledgments</em> of the
          other party’s own published standards, not as controlling authority over the Estate.</li>

        <li><strong>Service mechanics:</strong> The Estate’s formal service statement is:
          <em>“Served by Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested.”</em>
          Vendor names (if any) are evidentiary logistics only and belong in the private Trust Ledger.</li>

        <li><strong>Person/capacity naming:</strong> References to the LEGAL PERSON (e.g., all-caps name or “DEBTOR”)
          are descriptive only and do not confer suretyship. The Trustee does not act as the DEBTOR.</li>

        <li><strong>Addressing and venue:</strong> Use of “without the UNITED STATES” or similar phrasing is intended
          to avoid unintended venue assumptions and does not negate the Estate’s duty to act in honor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To avoid confusion, if any prior phrase conflicts with this clarification, <strong>this notice governs</strong>.
      </p>

      <h2>Effect and Relation-Back</h2>
    <p>
      This clarification is effective upon publication and relates back, <em>nunc pro tunc</em>, to each prior filing
      to the extent necessary to correct inadvertent statutory-sounding phrasing. All filings are to be read in
      pari materia with this notice; equity imputes an intention to fulfill an obligation, and form shall not defeat
      substance.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For clarity and completeness, this notice also affirms that the common-law maxim,
      <em>“Notice to agent is notice to principal, and notice to principal is notice to agent,”</em>
      applies nunc pro tunc to all prior presentments made by the Williams Family Estate™.
      Any notice served upon named officers, employees, or agents of a government agency
      was made in reliance upon said maxim and binds the agency as Principal in commerce and in law.

      <h2>Maxims Guiding Construction</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Equity looks to the intent rather than the form.</li>
        <li>Equity will not suffer a wrong to be without a remedy.</li>
        <li>Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights.</li>
      </ul>
