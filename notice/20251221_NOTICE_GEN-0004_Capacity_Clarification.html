      <h1>Notice of Trustee Capacity Clarification and Prospective Alignment</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="date">Published: December 21, 2025</div>
    <p>By: Gregory-Alan Williams, Trustee<br>
       Williams Family Estate™</p>

    <h2>Notice of Clarification</h2>

    <p>
      This notice is published in good faith for the purpose of clarity, alignment,
      and prevention of misunderstanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Trustee acknowledges that, in prior private dealings, there existed an
      incomplete understanding regarding <em>when</em> public clarification of trustee
      capacity is equitably required, particularly where conditional or anticipatory
      correspondence with third parties is contemplated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Trustee affirms that it has always been the intention to steward matters of
      substance—including real and intangible property—within the framework of private
      trust administration, while preserving the privacy of the trust res and the
      protection of beneficiaries, except where disclosure is equitably required to
      prevent confusion or injustice.
    </p>

    <h2>Prospective Clarification of Capacity</h2>

    <p>
      Accordingly, the Trustee hereby clarifies that any conditional, anticipatory, or
      responsive communications issued now or hereafter concerning matters touching the
      Estate are made in a trustee capacity, and not in a personal or individual
      capacity, unless expressly stated otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      This clarification is made <strong>prospectively</strong>, prior to the receipt
      or reliance upon any pending conditional correspondence by third parties, and is
      not intended to alter, deny, or impair any lawful obligation, security interest,
      or reliance properly arising before such clarification.
    </p>

    <h2>No Retroactive Effect Asserted</h2>

    <p>
      This notice does not assert retroactive recharacterization of past representations,
      nor does it seek to defeat any reliance formed in good faith prior to this
      clarification.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather, it serves to align outward notice with matured understanding, so that all
      future interactions may proceed with transparency of capacity and fairness of
      expectation.
    </p>

    <h2>Preservation of Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      Consistent with long-standing trust practice, the specific contents of the trust
      res remain private and are not disclosed herein. This notice is limited to the
      clarification of capacity and does not enumerate assets, beneficiaries, or
      internal trust accounting.
    </p>

    <h2>Statement of Good Faith</h2>

    <p>
      This notice is issued in the spirit of equity, conscience, and prevention of
      confusion. It is not adversarial in nature, nor is it intended as a declaration
      of dispute. It is published solely to ensure that no party may be misled as to the
      capacity in which the Trustee acts in matters now or hereafter touching the
      Estate.
    </p>

    <p>
      So published, this 21st day of December, 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Gregory-Alan Williams</strong><br>
      Trustee, Williams Family Estate™
