    <h1>Rebuttal of “Sovereign Citizen” Misclassification</h1>
    <div class="date">Filed: May 13, 2025</div>
    <p>Venue: Williams Family Estate™ – Public Notice Record - Identifier: X7N4V9</p>

    <p>
      Let it be publicly known that I, Gregory Alan of the House Williams, the living man and authorized Trustee of the Williams Family Estate™, rebut and lawfully reject any and all presumptions, classifications, or defamatory categorizations labeling me as a “sovereign citizen” or associated with any domestic extremist ideology.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not, nor have I ever been, affiliated with any group advocating violence, insurrection, or opposition to lawful governance. I am a private American man conducting all affairs in honor, good faith, and in accordance with divine law, natural law, and lawful due process.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any such false label is hereby rebutted for the record and any agency, court, or official using such classification is given lawful notice to cease and correct their record immediately. All lawful communications may be directed to the Trustee via the contact information maintained at <a href="https://williamsfamilyestate.org">williamsfamilyestate.org</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This rebuttal stands as a matter of public record and lawful notice to all municipal, state, and federal actors who may have relied on erroneous third-party filings or incomplete administrative data.
