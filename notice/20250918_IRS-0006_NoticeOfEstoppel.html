    <div class="date">Filed: September 18, 2025</div>
    <p>Venue: United States Department of the Treasury / Internal Revenue Service – Identifier: IRS-0006</p>

    <p><strong>To:</strong> Scott Bessent, Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue, successor in office to Billy Long and all predecessors noticed in 2025.</p>

    <p><em>Notice to Principal is Notice to Agent, Notice to Agent is Notice to Principal.</em></p>

    <p>
      Be it known that lawful presentments, affidavits, and notices were delivered in good faith to the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue beginning August 4, 2025. Each subsequent instrument was directed to the office at its proper venue, though the name “Billy Long” appeared as addressee in error. Trustee was not aware that Billy Long vacated the office on or about August 8, 2025, after a brief tenure of approximately two months. This defect is non-material and cured by relation back to the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue, which continued in existence and received said notices.
    </p>

    <p>
      By maxim, “Equity regards substance rather than form.” The notices, though bearing a misnomer, are deemed to have been served upon the Office of Commissioner of Internal Revenue itself. In equity and good conscience, they therefore bind the man presently exercising the functions of that office, namely Scott Bessent, Acting Commissioner.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Office, by silence and failure to rebut, entered dishonor. <em>Qui tacet consentire videtur</em> — silence where there is a duty to speak operates as consent. The defaults thus perfected run with the office, not with the man alone, and attach to all successors.
    </p>

    <p>
      Accordingly, this Notice of Estoppel is served upon you, Scott Bessent, in both your private and official capacity, as successor trustee of said office. Having been duly noticed, faulted, and defaulted, and having failed to cure within the reasonable timeframes set forth, the matter is now estopped. Neither you nor your office may contradict, deny, or otherwise controvert the perfected record of dishonor.
    </p>

    <p>
      This estoppel stands as a matter of equity, conscience, and law, binding upon you, your office, and all agents and assigns thereof. Any further attempt to controvert shall constitute fraud and bad faith.
    </p>

    <h2>Operation of Estoppel</h2>
    <p>
      By failure to rebut or cure the sworn testimony and lawful conditions set forth, the IRS and its agents are now <strong>permanently estopped</strong> from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Challenging the facts stated in the Affidavit of Status and Conditional Acceptance;</li>
      <li>Asserting jurisdiction or claim over the Williams Family Estate™ or its Trustee;</li>
      <li>Attempting collection or enforcement based on the unverified presentment;</li>
      <li>Denying default and dishonor;</li>
      <li>Denying the validity of the published Commercial Invoice and attached Fee Schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote>
      “He who does not deny, admits.”<br>
      “A matter must be expressed to be resolved.”<br>
      “Equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on their rights.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>All rights, title, and equitable standing are hereby affirmed and published in perpetuity. The record is now closed.</p>

    <h2>Claim for Performance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Liquidated damages in the amount of $250,000 USD, per published invoice and fee schedule;</li>
      <li>Ledger credit against the Private Performance Bond of the Williams Family Estate™, thereby reducing public liability in equal measure;</li>
      <li>Protection from future adverse action, interference, or commercial harassment by the Internal Revenue Service or its agents.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All further attempts at collection, enforcement, or contact regarding this matter shall be considered willful trespass, harassment, and dishonor in commerce.</p>

    <h2>Publication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Posted at: <a href="https://williamsfamilyestate.org/notice/IRS-0006/">https://williamsfamilyestate.org/notice/IRS-0006</a></li>
      <li>Retained in the Estate Ledger;</li>
      <li>Served via Certified Mail to the above-named party.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Done in good faith, in equity, with all rights reserved. This notice stands in the private, not in submission to any statutory jurisdiction, and is binding in conscience, honor, and law.
    </p>

    <h2>Bond Reference:</h2> 
    <p>
        Publication Addendum: This notice, as published to the Estate Ledger, is guaranteed and underwritten by the Private Performance Bond of the Williams Family Estate™ (Bond No. WFE-20250809-00A1-PB, published <a href="https://williamsfamilyestate.org/notice/20250809_RES_001001_PerformanceBond.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> ).
    </p>

    <h2>Publication Clarification</h2>

    <p>
        It is hereby clarified for the public record that the chain of IRS notices began with IRS-0001, not IRS-0003 as originally styled in the mailed Notice of Final Estoppel to Scott Bessent. 
        All references in this record to IRS-0003 through IRS-0006 shall be understood to mean IRS-0001 through IRS-0006. 
        This correction perfects the numbering for continuity of the Estate Ledger and does not alter the substance or effect of the notices.
