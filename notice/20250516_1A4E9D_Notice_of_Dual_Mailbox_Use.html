    <p>Venue: Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span> – Public Notice Record, Identifier: 1A4E9D</p>

    <p><strong>To all agents, officers, corporations, entities, and men or women who may send correspondence:</strong></p>

    <p>Be it known that the Trustee of the <strong>Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span></strong>, acting in honor and by right of private contract, hereby gives lawful and constructive notice that the current mailing address utilized by the Estate is also the private domicile of the living man, sui juris, known as <strong>Gregory-Alan: Williams</strong>.</p>

    <p>This temporary sharing of venue is a matter of convenience, not jurisdiction. It shall not be construed as a merger of persons, capacities, or entities. The Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span> exists as a distinct private trust res, separate from the living man and the public transmitting utility (DEBTOR).</p>

    <h2>Constructive Notice to USPS Agents and All Presenters</h2>
    <p>The designated mailbox at this address has been marked with a visible placard stating the following:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <strong>NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL</strong><br>
      This mailbox serves two capacities:<br>
      (1) Private Post for the Living Man: Gregory-Alan: Williams<br>
      (2) Lawful Presentments to: Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span> (Trust)<br><br>
      All presentments shall be treated according to private trust jurisdiction.<br>
      USPS agent agrees to deliver under these terms by constructive use.
    </blockquote>

    <p>This placard constitutes standing notice. Any party sending correspondence shall be deemed to have accepted these terms by performance, silence, or failure to rebut within ten (10) days of first delivery.</p>

    <h2>Legal and Equitable Distinction Preserved</h2>
    <p>This estate reiterates that no joinder or confusion of person shall be presumed, and that the capacity of the Trustee, the Trust, and the living man are each functionally and lawfully distinct.</p>

    <p>This Notice shall remain in effect unless or until replaced by a superseding notice duly filed within the public record of the Estate.</p>
