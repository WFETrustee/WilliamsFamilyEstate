    <p>Venue: Williams Family Estate™ Private Ledger</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Purpose of Notice</h2>
      <p>
        The Trustee of the Williams Family Estate™ hereby gives public notice and permanent record
        that all payments, disbursements, and performances rendered in the name of the legal person
        styled “GREGORY ALAN WILLIAMS,” or any derivative thereof, are commercial protests, not acts
        of consent or joinder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the Trustee has caused any presentment, invoice, demand, or claim to be satisfied—
        including but not limited to utilities, mortgages, taxes, or debts—such action was done solely
        to preserve the trust res, protect beneficiaries, and mitigate further injury. No presumption
        of suretyship, agency reversal, or legal submission shall arise from such performance.
      </p>

      <h2>Scope of Application</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Applies to all payments made in commerce from past to present and prospectively.</li>
        <li>Applies regardless of whether the invoice named the Trustee or the legal person.</li>
        <li>Includes all accounts, bills, taxes, fines, or contracts made under duress or threat of harm.</li>
        <li>All such events are entered into the private Estate Ledger as conditional tenders and recorded liabilities due to the Estate.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Standing Protest and Commercial Intent</h2>
      <p>
        Every payment or performance made shall be rebuttably presumed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To be made under protest and without prejudice;</li>
        <li>To be made to preserve shelter, heat, light, or life of the beneficiaries;</li>
        <li>To be logged as a commercial injury or offset against the public creditor;</li>
        <li>To be eligible for future setoff, discharge, or reimbursement via lien, bond, or lawful claim.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Reservation of Rights and Equity Jurisdiction</h2>
      <p>
        The Trustee stands in equity and does not waive any rights by temporary accommodation
        of fraudulent claims, artificial persons, or misapplied jurisdictions. All performances
        are made in good faith, without recourse, without assumption of public office, and
        with full reservation of rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        This notice stands as constructive notice to all present and future claimants and shall
        relate back <em>nunc pro tunc</em> to all past performances, subject to final ledger confirmation.
      </p>
