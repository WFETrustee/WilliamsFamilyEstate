    <h1>Public Notice: Schedule of Liquidated Damages for Dishonor and Injury to the Res</h1>
    <div class="date">Filed: August 22, 2025</div>
    <p>Venue: WilliamsFamilyEstate.org Public Notice Registry — Identifier: GEN-0001</p>

    <p>
      This Notice publishes the official <em>Schedule of Liquidated Damages</em> of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span> (“Estate”). 
      The amounts stated below are intended as <strong>fair pre‑estimates of loss</strong>
      to compensate injury to the res and to commerce. They are issued in equity, are <strong>compensatory and not punitive</strong>,
      and scale with the gravity and consequences of any dishonor or injury. All terms are offered in honor and good conscience.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the avoidance of doubt, all sums set forth herein are declared as 
      <strong>liquidated and compensatory damages</strong>, not penalties or forfeitures. 
      They represent fair pre-estimates of loss, injury, or risk to the res and beneficiaries, 
      calculated to restore the Estate to the position it ought to have occupied 
      had no dishonor or injury occurred. This schedule is grounded in the maxims of equity, 
      including that <em>equity abhors a penalty</em> and <em>equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy</em>. 
      The Estate does not seek punishment, only to be made whole in honor and good conscience.
    </p>

    <h2>General Principle of Continuing Harm:</h2>
    <p>
      Where an injury or dishonor persists over time, liquidated damages shall accrue daily until remedy, 
      whether or not daily accrual is expressly stated in the category above. Nothing herein limits the 
      Estate’s right to prove and recover actual damages if greater than the liquidated sums declared.
    </p>

    <h2>Terms of Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      All amounts are liquidated damages — fair pre‑estimates of loss — and are immediately due and payable upon dishonor or injury.
      Failure to cure within ten (10) days of notice constitutes default and consent to enforcement. All sums are enforceable in equity
      and commerce as lawful obligations of the dishonoring or injuring party. Remedies include, without limitation: setoff, lien, levy,
      or commercial claim. Nothing herein waives the Estate’s right to prove and recover <em>actual damages</em> if greater.
    </p>

    <h2>Publication</h2>
    <p>
      This schedule is hereby published as public notice and constitutes lawful terms of engagement in all dealings with the Estate. 
      By entering into any commercial interaction, correspondence, or dealing with the Estate, all parties are deemed to have constructive 
      notice of this Schedule of Liquidated Damages and consent to these terms of engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Notice of schedule is issued to preserve the res and protect beneficiaries; all rights reserved, without recourse.
