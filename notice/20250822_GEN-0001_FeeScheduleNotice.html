    <h1>Trust Fee Schedule: </h1>
    <p><strong>Schedule of Liquidated Damages for Dishonor and Injury to the Res</strong></p>
    <div class="date">Filed: August 22, 2025</div>
    <p>Venue: WilliamsFamilyEstate.org Public Notice Registry</p>

    <p>
      This Notice publishes the official <em>Schedule of Liquidated Damages</em> of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span> (“Estate”). 
      The amounts stated below are intended as <strong>fair pre-estimates of loss</strong>
      to compensate injury to the res and to commerce. They are issued in equity, are <strong>compensatory and not punitive</strong>,
      and scale with the gravity and consequences of any dishonor or injury. All terms are offered in honor and good conscience.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the avoidance of doubt, all sums set forth herein are declared as 
      <strong>liquidated and compensatory damages</strong>, not penalties or forfeitures. 
      They represent fair pre-estimates of loss, injury, or risk to the res and beneficiaries, 
      calculated to restore the Estate to the position it ought to have occupied 
      had no dishonor or injury occurred. This schedule is grounded in the maxims of equity, 
      including that <em>equity abhors a penalty</em> and <em>equity will not suffer a wrong without a remedy</em>. 
      The Estate does not seek punishment, only to be made whole in honor and good conscience.
    </p>

    <!-- NEW: minimum + cumulative + accrual clarification -->
    <p>
      All amounts herein are the <strong>minimum liquidated damages</strong> enforceable upon notice and presentment, and do not limit the Estate’s right to seek 
      <strong>additional equitable compensation</strong> where actual loss exceeds the scheduled sums. Fees are <strong>cumulative</strong> and may accrue concurrently 
      from the date of injury until cure, restoration, or final settlement.

    <h2>Terms of Enforcement</h2>
    
    <h3>Accrual of Damages and Continuing Harm</h3>
    <p>
      All sums herein accrue from the date of dishonor or injury until full cure, restoration, or settlement. 
      Where an injury or dishonor persists over time, liquidated damages shall continue to accrue daily until remedy, 
      whether or not daily accrual is expressly stated in the categories above. Interest at the prevailing commercial 
      rate may be applied to unpaid balances as additional compensation for delay.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Severability</h3>
    <p>
      If any provision of this Schedule of Liquidated Damages is found unenforceable or invalid in any forum, 
      all remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect. Each clause stands independently as a 
      lawful pre-estimate of loss, issued in equity to restore the Estate, and shall not be impaired by the 
      invalidity of any other clause.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Non-Waiver</h3>
    <p>
      No delay, silence, omission, or partial exercise of rights by the Estate shall be deemed a waiver of any 
      right, remedy, or claim. All rights remain preserved in equity and enforceable in full honor.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Cumulative Remedies</h3>
    <p>
      The remedies declared herein are cumulative. Assertion of one remedy shall not preclude pursuit of others 
      in equity or commerce to secure full restoration of the res.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Constructive Notice</h3>
    <p>
      By correspondence, contract, or interaction with the Williams Family Estate™, all parties are deemed to 
      have constructive notice of this Schedule and to have consented to its terms of engagement.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Survival</h3>
    <p>
      Obligations under this Schedule survive any settlement, discharge, or closure of the matter giving rise 
      to the claim until full performance is rendered and the Estate is made whole.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Governing Jurisdiction (Equity)</h3>
    <p>
      All matters arising under this Schedule shall be heard in equity and conscience, under the maxims of equity 
      and the private trust authority of the Williams Family Estate™.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Estoppel</h3>
    <p>
      Failure to rebut this Schedule point-for-point by sworn affidavit within the cure period constitutes 
      admission, agreement, and permanent estoppel against denial. All parties with notice, actual or constructive, 
      are barred in equity and conscience from later contesting its terms.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Publication</h3>
    <p>
      This Schedule is published as lawful notice and constitutes terms of engagement in all dealings with the Estate. 
      All parties entering commerce or correspondence with the Estate are deemed to have constructive notice and to 
      consent to these terms. Notice to any agent is notice to the principal, and notice to the principal is notice 
      to all agents.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This Notice of schedule is issued to preserve the res and protect beneficiaries; all rights reserved, without recourse.
