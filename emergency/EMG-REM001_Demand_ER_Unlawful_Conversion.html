        Garner, North Carolina<br>
        without the UNITED STATES
      </blockquote>

      <p>This property and all rights associated with its use and occupancy are held in trust, secured under perfected commercial claim by the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span>, recorded and unrebutted. Any agent, officer, lender, or third-party actor attempting to remove the Trustee or disturb the peaceable enjoyment of the estate's property without verified lawful claim shall be acting under color of law, fraud, and without jurisdiction.</p>

      <h3>Commercial and Legal Basis for Relief</h3>

        <li>Property is part of a registered, private trust estate with lawful priority claim</li>
        <li>There exists no verified, lawful wet-ink contract binding the living man as surety that includes full disclosure, bilateral signatures, and lawful consideration—nor any rebuttal to the perfected interest of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Lawful Demand</h3>

        <li>A verified claim from an injured party under penalty of perjury</li>
        <li>A lawful bond trail or CUSIP associated with the alleged account</li>
        <li>Proof that the perfected security interest of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">™</span> has been lawfully rebutted and nullified</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Warning of Liability</h3>
      <p>Any further attempt to violate this demand shall constitute:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conversion and trespass under color of law</li>
        <li>Deprivation of rights secured by 18 USC §242</li>
        <li>Actionable harm under 42 USC §1983</li>
        <li>Personal and commercial liability under tort and equity</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Reservation of Rights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All rights reserved without prejudice, UCC §1-308</li>
        <li>Constitutional protections against seizure without due process</li>
        <li>Equitable standing as Trustee over registered private trust estate</li>
      </ul>
