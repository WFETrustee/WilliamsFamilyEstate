            Garner, North Carolina<br>
            without the UNITED STATES
          </blockquote>

          <p>This property and all rights associated with its use and occupancy are held in trust, secured under perfected commercial claim by the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span>, recorded and unrebutted. Any agent, officer, lender, or third-party actor attempting to remove the Trustee or disturb the peaceable enjoyment of the estate's property without verified lawful claim shall be acting under color of law, fraud, and without jurisdiction.</p>

            <li>A verified claim from an injured party under penalty of perjury</li>
            <li>A lawful bond trail or CUSIP associated with the alleged account</li>
            <li>Proof that the perfected security interest of the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span> has been lawfully rebutted and nullified</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Warning of Liability</h3>

          </ul>

          <h3>Reservation of Rights</h3>
