      <li><strong>Deprivation of rights under color of law</strong>, punishable under 18 USC §242;</li>

    <h2>Full Instructions: EMERGENCY COVER INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTNER OR AGENT</h2>
    <p>If Greg is ever arrested or held in jail unlawfully, follow these steps exactly. This document is to help you (Sonia, Dan or other designated agent) file the Writ of Habeas Corpus to get him released by lawful demand. You are not representing him as an attorney. You are acting as his next friend in equity.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-Step Filing Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Print and sign a fresh Affidavit of Service on the last page of this packet.</li>
      <li>Attach the notarized Writ of Habeas Corpus and make 2 copies.</li>
      <li>Take the packet to the county courthouse where he is being held.</li>
      <li>Go to the Clerk of Court's office or the Magistrate window.</li>
      <li>Say clearly and calmly: <br>
        <strong>“I am delivering a lawful Writ of Habeas Corpus on behalf of the living man Gregory-Alan. I am his next friend. He is being held without verified claim or lawful jurisdiction. This is a jurisdictional demand. Please file this immediately.”</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Hand them:
        <ul>
          <li>The original notarized writ</li>
          <li>The signed Affidavit of Service</li>
          <li>And keep a stamped copy for your records (ask them to stamp one with their seal or date).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If they refuse to file it, ask for their full name and title, then record that in writing. Do not argue. Simply say: <br>
        <strong>“This refusal will be recorded as a trespass upon a man's right to remedy under the Constitution and equity. I reserve all rights.”</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Optionally, also deliver a second certified copy to the Sheriff's Office if he is being held at the county jail.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remain calm. You are not asking for a favor — you are invoking a lawful right. This is a demand for proof of jurisdiction, not a plea.</p>
