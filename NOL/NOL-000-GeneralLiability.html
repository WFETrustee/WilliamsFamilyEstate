          <p><strong>NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL IS NOTICE TO AGENT. NOTICE TO AGENT IS NOTICE TO PRINCIPAL.</strong></p>

          <p>Greetings,</p>

          <p>This document serves as a lawful <strong>Notice of Liability</strong>, issued by a living man/woman operating in full capacity, with clean hands, under natural law and private trust jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>I am placing you on notice for your role in the authorization, promotion, distribution, and/or willful concealment of harmful effects caused by the continued presence of <strong>[e.g., glyphosate, aluminum hydroxide, fluoride, etc.]</strong> in <strong>[specify domain: food supply, water, medical treatments, etc.]</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Affidavit of Fact</h2>

          <p>I, [Your Given Name]: [Family Name], a living man/woman of sound mind and body, do hereby solemnly affirm and declare the following to be true and correct to the best of my knowledge and ability:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>That I am not a corporate fiction, franchise, or agent of the UNITED STATES or any of its sub-corporations.</li>
            <li>That I have consumed or been involuntarily exposed to [substance], which has been scientifically documented to cause [list known harms].</li>
            <li>That your agency/corporation has had reasonable access to these facts through published studies, regulatory filings, lawsuits, and expert testimony since at least [YYYY].</li>
            <li>That [substance] remains present in the public [food/water/medical] supply under your administration or endorsement.</li>
            <li>That your continued inaction and/or misleading public statements constitute willful negligence and trespass upon my biological property and peaceable enjoyment of life.</li>
            <li>That this notice is issued in good faith with the intent to lawfully resolve this matter.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>I reserve all rights at law and in equity. I do not consent to further harm. You are now held personally liable for any future or ongoing injury or interference as a result of your willful non-action or misrepresentation.</p>

          <p>You are granted <strong>twenty-one (21) days</strong> from the date of receipt of this notice to respond and provide evidence of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The absence of harm from [substance],</li>
            <li>Your agency‚Äôs lack of jurisdiction or responsibility,</li>
            <li>Immediate remedial action initiated to halt further exposure or harm.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Failure to respond within the time allotted shall constitute tacit agreement and confession by acquiescence, and this notice will stand as a <strong>lawful affidavit of truth and liability</strong>.</p>

          <br>
          <p>Sincerely and without malice,</p>
