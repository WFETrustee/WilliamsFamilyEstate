        <h1>Send Notice to the Estate</h1>

        <p>
            All parties wishing to communicate with or provide notice to the
            <strong>Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span></strong>
            may do so through the Estate’s designated correspondence channel:
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            <a href="mailto:notices@williamsfamilyestate.org?subject=Notice%20to%20the%20Estate">
                notices@williamsfamilyestate.org
            </a>
        </p>

        <p>
            This electronic channel is provided for <em>convenience, preliminary communication,
            and informal notice only</em>, and exists to allow good-faith parties to identify
            themselves, state the nature of their concern, and request appropriate direction
            from the Trustee.
        </p>

        <p>
            Electronic correspondence <strong>does not constitute formal presentment,
            lawful service, or compulsory notice in equity</strong>, and is not accepted
            as such unless expressly acknowledged by the Trustee in writing.
        </p>

        <p>
            All electronic correspondence must be in written form, identify the sending
            party and their claimed capacity, and clearly state the subject matter or cause
            for communication. Successful delivery constitutes receipt for review only and
            does not imply acceptance, agreement, obligation, or jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>Formal Presentment and Lawful Service</h2>

        <p>
            Where formal presentment or compulsory notice is required in equity and good
            conscience, such presentment must be accomplished by proper written delivery
            through a <strong>physical channel designated by the Trustee</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For reasons of safety, privacy, and protection of the family and beneficiaries,
            the Estate’s physical location and delivery instructions are not published publicly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any party asserting a lawful need to effect formal presentment may request
            appropriate delivery instructions <em>in writing</em> through the electronic
            channel above. Instructions, if any, are provided by private reply, upon
            verification of purpose and standing, and only where lawful, necessary,
            and appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Failure to request or follow proper presentment instructions may result in
            correspondence being treated as informal, incomplete, or non-actionable.
        </p>

        <h2>Recordkeeping and Publication</h2>

        <p>
            The Trustee may, at their sole discretion, choose to respond to, preserve,
            or publish correspondence — in whole or in part — as part of the public
            record of the Estate, subject to redaction where appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>
            All communications are subject to the private terms of trust and equity,
            must be delivered in good faith, and must be free from malice, coercion,
            or misrepresentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are responding to a published notice, please cite the notice’s
            <strong>title and publication date</strong> in the subject line or message body
            to ensure accurate association with the public record.
        </p>
