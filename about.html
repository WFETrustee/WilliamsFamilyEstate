        </div>
      
        <p>
          Heavenly Father, I stand before You in the office of Trustee of the Williams Family Estate
          <span class="tm">&trade;</span>, not by my own power but by Your appointment and grace. I acknowledge that all
          authority flows from You, and that all honor is sustained in Christ Jesus, who said:
        </p>
      
        <blockquote class="jesus-quote">
          <p><em>“Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.”</em></p>
          <footer>&mdash; <cite>Matthew 5:9</cite></footer>
        </blockquote>
      
        <p>
          I take no action for war, nor for rebellion, but for peace and remedy in equity. I declare that this estate and
          all entrusted to it are Yours, and I serve only as steward in good faith.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Lord Jesus, You taught:
        </p>
      
        <blockquote class="jesus-quote">
          <p><em>“Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.”</em></p>
          <footer>&mdash; <cite>Matthew 22:21</cite></footer>
        </blockquote>
      
        <p>
          I render now unto You the estate’s trust res, bond, and record. Protect them from misuse, theft, or dishonor.
          Let no weapon formed against this estate prosper, and let every tongue that would rise against it in judgment be
          condemned, for this is the heritage of the servants of the Lord.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I bind myself and this act to truth, equity, and honor. I ask You to shield my children and family from any
          retaliation or harm. I ask You to give wisdom to those who receive these notices, that they may recognize the path
          of peace and equity over the path of conflict and destruction.
        </p>
      
        <blockquote class="jesus-quote">

        </blockquote>
      
        <p>
          Let this notice stand in truth. Let it be recorded in Heaven as well as on Earth. Let all who touch it be convicted
          in conscience, so that remedy may come through peace and not revolution.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          I seal this invocation in the name of Jesus Christ, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, my Savior and Advocate.
        </p>
      
        <p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>

            Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, I consecrate this act of trusteeship to You. Let truth, equity, and honor
            govern this notice. Protect my family and the Williams Family Estate<span class="tm">&trade;</span>, and grant
            peaceable remedy to all parties. Amen.
